Is this an inventory application?

This is a project submission for The Odin Project NodeJS Course, Project: Inventory Application.

The goal of this project is to strengthen my understanding of Express.js (EJS as its templating engine) and how to build a full‑stack app with a relational database (using Postgres). I wanted to practice structuring routes, controllers, and views, while also handling validation and redirects.

## Get Started

To get started, clone this repo and run `npm run install` to install dependencies; then configure a `.env` file with the structure of `.env.example`.

Use `local` for locally hosted db, and `cloud` if services like Neon is used. Then run the seed script `npm run seed`.
